## My process
   
   - I created the html file first
   - Added the CSS, (designed mobile first), so I designed for the desktop view after I was done with the mobile view.
   - Created the menu functions in JS for both the mobile and desktop view.
   - Implemented the carting functions.
   - Created the image view functions.
   - Created the lightbox for the desktop view, and I was done.
   
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

 This challenge helped me learn quite a few new things...
 - I learned how to clone an existing element in the dom, into another element, and display the output.
  you can see that in line 150 of the JavaScript file. 
 - I Was able to learn how to create a function image lightbox with vanilla js. you can also see how I implemented that in line 134 of the js file.
 - I learned how to create an items carting feature, which updates the cart according to how many items were carted. First time doing that, so I was excited as I was able to figure that out. you can check out how I implemented that from line 86 to line 124 in the js file.
 

### Continued development
 I am looking forward to learning and really understanding how to use React for development, and I might be doing that in my next project (really excited about this journey)
 
 
### Useful resources

 This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand how to clone elements. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
