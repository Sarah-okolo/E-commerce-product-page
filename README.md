## My process
   
   -I created the html file first
   -Added the css, (designed mobile first), so i designed for the desktop view after i was done with the mobile view.
   -created the menu functions in js for both the mobile and desktop view.
   -created the carting functions.
   -created the images view functions.
   -created the lightbox for the desktop view, and i was done.
   
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

 *This challange helped me learn quite a few new things...
 -I learned how to clone an existing element in the dom, into another element, and display the output.
  you can see that in line 158 of the JavaScript file. 
 -Was able to learn how to create a function image lightbox with vanilla js. you can also see how i implemented that in line 158 of the js file.
 -I learned how to create an items carting function, which updates the cart according to how many items were carted, first time doing that, so i was really excited i was able to figure that out. you can check out how i implemented that from line 77 to line 128 in the js file.
 

### Continued development
 -I am looking forward to learn and really understand how to use Ajax for development, and i might be doing that in my next project (really excited about this journey)
 
 
### Useful resources
